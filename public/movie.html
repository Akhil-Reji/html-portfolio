<h1>AKHIL'S MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>
<h2>My Favourite Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>It is a sci-fic movie. Its about a man travelling to space inorder to relocate earth-beings, as the planet is destroying itself. It has some of the best images and scenes, <br />
    "especially the background music is the best"</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Its also a sci-fic movie. Its about travelling through dreams. Leonardo di Caprio is the main character in this film. Its a complicated subject, will really enjoy watching the movie.</p>
<h3>Ford vs Ferrari</h3>
<p>Its a movie about the introduction of one of the best cars in the world.<br />
THE FORD GT <br />
It shows why ford decided to build a powerful beast like that and who were the ones involved in the making. In this movie we can witness the rivalry between ford motors and ferrari. </p>
